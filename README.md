- Implemented visualization, feature engineering, and preprocessing on raw data.
- Modelled data with logistic regression classification.
- Selected f1 score as evaluation measurement due to data imbalance.
- Implemented combined SMOTE oversampling and random undersampling.
- Implemented Hyperparameter tuning with random search algorithm.
- Calculated optimal threshold for precision-recall curve.
- Implemented feature importance to find features with the greatest effect.
